# Planit - Frontend

Planit is a web app designed to simplify event planning by allowing users to select their availability for existing events, create new events, and view event results. Upon first access, users can explore information about the app, including FAQs, features, about the app, and contact details. After logging in, they are redirected to a personalized dashboard.

The dashboard allows users to:
- **Create new events**: Share them with other participants and collect availability.
- **View events they've created or participated in**, with the ability to track progress.
- **See event results**, with the aggregation of all participants' availability.

Event administrators can vote on proposed availability options and select the final event date and time. Non-admin users can vote on available time slots and view the group's aggregated availability.

Planit makes the event organization process more transparent and collaborative, facilitating the management of availability and the final date selection with active participation from all users.
